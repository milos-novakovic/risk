This project develops a modular, end-to-end Risk Analytics Pipeline designed to showcase data engineering, data science, and financial risk-management skills through the calculation of historical Value-at-Risk (VaR). The pipeline ingests multi-source (different business lines) position data and historical market prices, stores them in a documented relational schema, and performs data cleaning using mainly python pandas and SQL-based transformations. A 1-day, 99\% historical VaR with a one-year lookback window is computed at multiple aggregation levels, including individual business lines, metal categories, and the whole consolidated portfolio. The system emphasizes transparency through clear assumptions, reproducible methodology, and modular code design. Final outputs include a structured Excel report summarizing VaR results, along with a technical markdown documenting the approach, challenges, and recommendations.
